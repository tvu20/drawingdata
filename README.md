# Drawing Data Final Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Build Notes

Created using React.js. This build can be cloned and run using npm. 

This is still very much a work in progress; the current template tests the functionality of clicking different images to create modals with different text inputs. The individual data for each of the groups is stored in a separate JSON file.

### Next week's improvements

Begin adding finished pieces of artwork to the site, updating the JSON file to include information for all the groups, and maybe adding more robust CSS.
